Terrible pollution in Beijing

Data collected based on action plan

reduce pollutants by 25%

This data set includes hourly air pollutants data from 12 nationally-controlled air-quality monitoring sites. The air-quality data are from the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center. The meteorological data in each air-quality site are matched with the nearest weather station from the China Meteorological Administration. The time period is from March 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2017. Missing data are denoted as NA.

cleaned up data files, 12 station files, combined into 1
for plotting, grouped by station and date
calculated Air Quality Index (AQI)

histograms of AQI values 

created interactive map of places and times around beijing with a graph of their data
can answer questions using the map 

##what python tools did you use to map the map?
	leaflet - can use in jupyter 
	vq plot - wasn't very user friendly choice, would have used one with more interaction 
##how did you find the latlongs of the stations? 


AQI values peaked in February 2015 - chinese new year 
		busiest time of year for travel, and fireworks
