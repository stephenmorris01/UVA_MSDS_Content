Tasks:
1. Create three user types for your scenarios

2. Create 10-15 user stories for the backlog. Place these user stories on the list titled “Product Backlog (User Stories)”

3. Determine which user stories should be placed in Sprint 1. Create new cards on the list “Sprint 1 (User Stories).”

4. Prioritize the user stories for Sprint 1. Create new cards on the list “Prioritized Sprint 1 (User Stories).”

5. Create tasks for the first Sprint. Add cards to the list “Tasks Per User Story for Sprint 1.”

6. Repeat steps 2-4 for the second Sprint (scenario 2). If you continue to scroll to the right on the Trello board, you’ll see the same categories set up for Sprint 2 as were set up for Sprint 1.






Be sure to use the following format for writing your user stories:
As a [user-type], I want to [user-action] [for a reason].

User stories (green) describe in layman’s terms a goal of a product user and why that goal exists. It should be described in a non technical way so that its meaning is equally understood by all parts of the business. A user story takes the form “As a [user-type], I want to [user-action] [for a reason]."

A Task (purple) that needs to be done that must be completed as part of the Minimum Viable Product.
